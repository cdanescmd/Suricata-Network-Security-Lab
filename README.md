# Network Security Monitoring Lab (Suricata)

## Overview
This project demonstrates the deployment and operation of Suricata IDS in a Linux-based environment to monitor and analyze network traffic. The goal was to gain hands-on experience with intrusion detection, alert analysis, and troubleshooting common deployment issues in low-resource environments.

## Architecture
- Linux VM (Ubuntu)
- Suricata IDS
- Monitored network interface
- Test client generating traffic

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Network traffic inspection and IDS deployment
- Suricata rule management and alert analysis
- Linux service and network troubleshooting
- Log analysis and documentation
- Security monitoring fundamentals

## Challenges & Solutions
- Resolved Suricata startup failures caused by incorrect network interface configuration
- Addressed resource constraints on low-memory systems
- Validated rule loading and alert generation

## Outcomes
- Successfully stabilized Suricata service
- Gained practical experience analyzing IDS logs and traffic patterns
- Developed a repeatable deployment and troubleshooting process

## Disclaimer
This project was conducted in a controlled lab environment for educational purposes only.
