# Traffic Observations

## Baseline Traffic
Normal network activity included common client-server communication patterns such as outbound connections and routine service requests.

## Anomalous Patterns
Occasional traffic patterns deviated from the baseline and triggered IDS alerts. These deviations highlighted how changes in frequency, destination, or behavior can indicate potential issues.

## Security Relevance
Analyzing traffic patterns provided insight into how network visibility supports early detection of suspicious activity before it escalates into confirmed incidents.

## Key Takeaways
Understanding baseline network behavior is essential for effective intrusion detection and reducing false positives.
