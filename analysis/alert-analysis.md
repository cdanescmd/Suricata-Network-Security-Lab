# Alert Analysis

## Alert Review Process
Alerts generated by Suricata were reviewed to understand the types of network activity being detected and how rule-based intrusion detection identifies potentially suspicious behavior.

## Common Alert Categories
Observed alerts generally fell into categories such as:
- Suspicious connection patterns
- Policy violations
- Unusual traffic behavior

These categories helped prioritize which alerts required closer review.

## False Positives & Noise
Some alerts reflected benign activity that triggered detection rules. These events were evaluated to distinguish between normal traffic and behavior that warranted investigation.

## Analyst Perspective
This exercise reinforced the importance of context when reviewing IDS alerts, as alerts alone do not necessarily indicate malicious activity without supporting evidence.
