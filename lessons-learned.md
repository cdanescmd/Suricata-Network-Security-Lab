# Lessons Learned

## Environment Awareness Matters
Deploying Suricata reinforced the importance of understanding the underlying system environment. Differences in network interfaces, resource availability, and virtualization settings can significantly impact security tool behavior.

## Validation Before Deployment
Configuration testing and validation proved essential before enabling services. Small misconfigurations, such as incorrect rule paths or interface references, can prevent security tools from functioning entirely.

## Alerts Require Context
Reviewing IDS alerts highlighted that detection systems generate signals, not conclusions. Effective security monitoring depends on contextual analysis and an understanding of normal network behavior.

## Operational Mindset
This project emphasized the need for an operational mindset when working with security tooling, balancing detection capabilities with system stability and performance constraints.
